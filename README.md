# Introduction

This repository contains **Practice 1** from my **Operating Systems** course. In this assignment, I began working with **Linux** while performing various activities in **C**. Although this is not my first experience with C, this course will take me to a higher level of complexity in systems programming.

## Learning Experience

For this practice, I explored fundamental **Linux commands, process management, and system interactions**. I also worked on programming tasks in C that reinforced my understanding of **low-level programming** and **how an operating system manages resources**.

This is just the beginning of a subject that will require a deep understanding of **system calls, memory management, and concurrency**, among other advanced topics.

## Ongoing Journey

Since this is only the first practice, I am still at the start of a challenging but exciting learning process. As the course progresses, I expect to tackle more complex problems and gain a stronger grasp of **how operating systems function at a deeper level**.

## Conclusion

This repository marks my first step into **advanced operating systems programming**. It serves as a foundation for the more demanding topics to come, and I am eager to continue improving my skills in **Linux, C, and system-level programming**.
